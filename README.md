# Hydroponics

<h1 align="center"><Hydroponics System></h1>
<p align="center"><In this project, the raspberry pi 4B will be the controller of the Hydroponics System which connected to the Arduino Nano with the sensors and water pumps. The sensor data will trasfer throught the IoT grafana and InflexDB. VNC will be used in order to remote the Raspberry Pi></p>

## Pin connection:
  

In the project directory, you can run:

### Sensor Testing:

- [Arduino Code](https://github.com/Chrischrislch/Hydroponics/tree/main/Sensor%20testing)

### Serial communication between Arduino and Raspberry Pi,

In the Arduino IDE, open the Serial Monitor
To find the corresponding USB port name, pls type "ls  /dev/ttyUSB*" in the Raspberry Pi Terminal.

-[Code](https://github.com/Chrischrislch/Hydroponics/tree/main/SerialTest)

### `"npm run test": "react-scripts test"`,

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `"npm run dev": "concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`,

For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together.

### `"serve": "node server"`

For running the server file on you can use this command.

### `npm run serve`

## Built With
